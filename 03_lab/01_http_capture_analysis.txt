Environment: VMware Workstation – Kali Linux
Browser Used: Firefox
Tool Used: Wireshark

Objective:
To capture and analyze basic HTTP traffic and understand how a normal web request looks at packet level.

Website Visited:
http://www.example.com

Interface Used:
eth0 (primary network interface)

Packets Observed:

1. DNS Query to resolve example.com  
2. TCP Three-Way Handshake  
   - SYN  
   - SYN-ACK  
   - ACK  
3. HTTP GET Request  
4. HTTP Response 200 OK  

Filter Used in Wireshark:
http

Key Observations:

- The browser first generated a DNS request to find the IP address of example.com.
- After receiving the IP, a TCP handshake was performed.
- HTTP protocol was used because the site was accessed using http:// instead of https://.
- The GET request contained the path “/” indicating the homepage request.
- Server responded with status code 200 OK, meaning request was successful.

Learning Outcome:

- Understood how normal HTTP traffic appears in Wireshark.
- Learned to apply basic filters.
- Identified relationship between DNS, TCP, and HTTP protocols.
